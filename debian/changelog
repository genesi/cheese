  * New upstream release:
    - camera: emit video-saved signal by name in gst threads
    Static camera_signals array is not initizialized in the gstreamer thread
    so we get a critical assertion failed (signal_id > 0) if we emit by id.
    This should workaround the issue. (LP: #587853)

cheese (2.27.4-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * New upstream release: (LP: #399056)
    - ensure the drawing area has a native X11 window
      With the new client-side-window gtk+ widgets do not always have a
      native window anymore. We need an XID to give to GstXOverlay and embed
      video into the application. This temporarily works around the issue
      forcing a native window. Works around bug 588357
    - use the camera-web icon instead of camera-video
      we are using camera-web in the project logo/icon but camera-video for the
      UI. it is more appropriate to use the camera-web icon as it's a) less
      likely people will use camcorders with cheese b) there is bigger visual
      distinction between camera-photo and camera-web than camera-photo and
      camera-video.
    - manually expose the window if not PLAYING
      Draw a black background if the pipeline is starting up and the overlay
      is still not ready to expose the drawing area.
    - fix broken xoverlay management
      For some reason this went unnoticed for a long time. We were calling
      set_x_overlay right after setting PLAYING state (with no warranty that
      the state change succeeded nor that an overlay was really there). The
      only right way to do this is to wait for prepare-xwindow-id message. It
      worked until now just because we've been extremely lucky.
    - drop url and email handlers
      Drop url and email handlers used in the about dialog since gtk+ 2.17.2
      already provides that functionality built in.
    - drop GEditMessageArea in favor of GtkInfoBar
      Drop GEditMessageArea since it recently entered gtk+. Fixes bug #586545
    - use AM_SILENT_RULES if available, fixes bug #587581
    - Use accessor functions instead direct access, fixes bug #585210
    - remove markup from translatable strings
    - keybindings: add configure checks for needed X11 stuff
      Check for XF86keysym.h availability and add a configure option to
      disable Webcam Button listening. Copied from rhythmbox.
    - add little program to emit fake webcam button events
    - capture webcam buttons
      Listen to XF86Webcam keypresses to capture webcam buttons. Should
      work with every driver that correctly binds the input device to
      KEY_CAMERA events. Fixes bug #521551
    - remove padding from the take_picture button
      Use alignment xscale property instead of padding in the take_picture
      button. Doesn't fix but at least partly works around bug #573301 (the
      button can now grow up and fill the whole free space with no padding
      constraint).
    - sanitize main toolbar structure
      No real change, just some little restructuring of the glade toolbar
      definition to make it easier to hack on.
  * debian/control:
    - Bump gtk+ requirement to 2.17.3
    - Add build-dep on x11proto-core-dev for multimedia keys
    - Add build-dep on docbook-utils
  * debian/rules:

cheese (2.27.3-0ubuntu1) karmic; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Set default resolution to the highest one with a non jerky (higher than
      15fps) framerate, fixes bug
    - Lower max-delay and max-page-delay oggmux properties from 5 to 0.5
      seconds. Should prevent out of sync audio in recorded videos and
      hopefully fix bug (LP: #241422)
    - Don't access effects string after free. This was causing the first effect
      stored in gconf to not be restored at startup, fixes bug 584186
    - Get rid of GtkAspectFrame, it doesn't really suit our needs, it hardcodes
      an aspect ratio that obviously cannot be valid for every format webcams
      support. Render the video directly to the drawing area with no external
      aspect ratio restriction. Eventually fixes bug #559188 since the
      aspectframe was adding some extra padding between the video and the window
      border.
    - Almost every available gstreamer videosink can display black bars around
      the video keeping its aspect ratio. Enable it if available.
      Black bars look a lot nicer than the grey color of the underlying
      gtkwindow displayed with the aspectframe.
    - Properly forward expose events to GstXOverlay.
    - Avoid ugly flickering on window resize. Let gstxoverlay take full control
      of the drawing area window. Prevent gtk from drawing the background and
      remove the flickering caused by its internal double buffering.
    - Remove initial black bars (at least for 4:3 webcams). Set a default window
      size that fits nicely the video aspect ratio so that black bars are not
      drawn until a manual resize.
